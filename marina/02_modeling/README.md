- `01_Classification.ipynb` : This approach aims to classify the bird species based on the raw data from Switzerland to get a sense of the distinctiveness of the bird species.
- `02_Emergent_Filters.ipynb` : This notebook implements the Emergent Filters approach applied by eBird. We want to use it as a benchmark.
- `03_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb` : This notebook implements our Anomaly Detection approach which aims to identify anomalous data points. We generate one model per species.
