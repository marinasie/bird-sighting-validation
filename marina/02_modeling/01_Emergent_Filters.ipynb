    "## Objective\n",
    "Our first approach to detecting unusual sightings is adapted directly from eBird, an established citizen science project that allows the general public to contribute to a global database of bird observations. Part of their process is what they call Emergent Filters, which only factor in the location and date of the sighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Emergent Filter, as described by eBird, is a data-driven filter that emerges from the analysis of historical data. Instead of using pre-defined filters set by experts, the Emergent Filter is generated based on patterns and frequencies observed in the historical data itself. [1] \n",
    "\n",
    "In the specific case of the eBird project, the Emergent Filter is based on the frequency of reporting a species. The frequency is calculated as the number of checklists (i.e. sightings) that reported a particular species divided by the total number of checklists submitted for a specific region. Checklists of species whose occurrence frequency surpasses a pre-defined threshold are included in the eBird database, while observations falling below the threshold are flagged as unusual. The Emergent Data filter is constantly updated as new data is reported, making it a dynamic and adaptive mechanism for identifying patterns and outliers in bird observations [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to adopt this approach due to its established usage at eBird. Additionally, we intend to use this approach as a benchmark for our Outlier Detection approach, which also incorporates more sophisticated features such as land use, altitude, etc. (see *02_Outlier_Detection.ipynb*).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "In this notebook, we implement this concept and calculate Emergent Filters for the 27 species chosen by ornitho.de and ornitho.ch. Additionally, we showcase some selected species' filters over the course of the year to assess their potential effectiveness and demonstrate how to utilize Emergent Filters for flagging unusual sightings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitation\n",
    "The evaluation and optimization of this approach is not within the scope of this notebook since at the time this notebook was employed, no evaluation data was available. It will be conducted in the future in the chapter *04_evaluation* as part of the *Hauptprojekt*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output data\n",
    "You can download the Emergent Filter lookup table using 50x50km grids for prediction of 2023 data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10jRb7Gxx2Q9mgGDYUaIFq8QAAzW3lQD4)."

    "Next, eBird computes a metric that reflects the frequency of species reporting. This metric is obtained by dividing the number of checklists reporting a specific species by the total number of checklists submitted for a particular region. The outcome provides an indication of the 'probability' of encountering a particular bird species within that specific region. Since each observation includes information about the bird's location and time of detection, it becomes feasible to calculate the occurrence frequencies of bird species at various spatial scales and for any given date [1].\n",

To address this issue, as the only adjustment to the eBird methodology, we intoduce an additional centered rolling window. This window averages values over a 30-day period, with the intent of mitigating fluctuations and achieving a smoother representation of the data."

    "The garganey is a migratory bird that travels to Africa and south Asia for more abundant food resources [2]. Therefore, their presence near Hannover is unlikely during the winter months. In spring, it returns to its breeding grounds, and the likelihood of sightings increases as individuals travel through and engage in courtship, nesting activities, and the search for suitable breeding habitats. This contributes to a higher probability of observations during the spring season. Similarly, during autumn, the garganey undergoes migration from its breeding grounds to wintering areas. Observations become more plausible in autumn as they pass through or gather in staging areas before their migratory journey.\n",

    "Upon analyzing data for the Knäkente below, we can confirm that the Emergent Filters indeed reflect these migration patterns. During the winter season, a consistent flagging pattern emerges where the sighting of a migratory bird would be unusal. The observed trend in the graph also aligns with the species' migration phenology during spring and autumn, where their submitted sightings peak. During summer, the garganey is not sighted as often as during spring and autumn, but is still considered plausible."

    "While the selected grid around Hannover is not a prime location for eagle sightings, eBird records a multitude of sightings in that area. Therefore, we anticipate that a sighting in the chosen grid would typically be classified as plausible by the Emergent Filters. As can be seen in the chart below, this is the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the White-tailed eagle is not a migratory bird, so sightings are plausible all year round. In line with this, within the chosen grid and using a 5% threshold, the White-tailed eagle would consistently be marked as plausible when applying the Emergent Filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "During spring, the eagles engage in courtship rituals, nesting activities, and the exploration of suitable breeding habitats, contributing to an increased probability of sightings, which can again be confirmed by our Emergent Filters. The increased sighting plausibility in autumn is not straight-forward to explain; it may be rooted in minor seasonal movements or an increased exploration in preparation for winter.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is noticeable that despite its rarity, the White-tailed eagle accounts for a relatively high percentage of sightings. This could be attributed to user bias, as the probability of reporting a sighting is much higher when it involves a white-tailed eagle compared to more common bird species."

In this process, we simply need to extract the dataframe row corresponding to the relevant species, grid, and date, and retrieve the plausibility value. If this value falls below the predetermined threshold (here set at 5%), the `flagged_for_review` flag is set to True. An expert can subsequently filter based on this flag and review the corresponding sightings. Similarly, a system with continuous values could be established, allowing the plausibility value to be directly associated with the new sighting. An expert can then sort the sightings by plausibility, starting with those having the lowest plausibility values."

    "Therefore, we intend to utilize this approach as a benchmark for our outlier analysis. While they are relatively resource-efficient to compute, they narrow down data points solely on location and time, disregarding other features that can significantly influence plausibility. For instance, a Knäkente with Atlas code 0 might be highly plausible, while one with a high Atlas code (indicating breeding) could be quite unusual outside of the breeding season.\n",

    "We aim to benchmark the Emergent Filters against our outlier analysis to test whether the outlier analysis, which considers all features and employs common outlier detection algorithms, performs better, equal, or worse. This comparison will help us determine whether the established Emergent Filters, while straightforward, are indeed effective or if the more comprehensive outlier analysis offers superior performance by encompassing all available features and calculations."
